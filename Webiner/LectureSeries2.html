                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240); text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "><b>Abstract:</b> Many decades after quantum mechanics including Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics was accepted as a more accurate model of the physical world, Richard Feynman proposed the brilliant vision of building computers based on quantum mechanical systems in 1981. Rolf Landauer had established the importance of reversibility with respect to energy dissipation of a computational process in 1961. Thus the two major drivers for the development of quantum computing have been the need to overcome the time complexity limitations of classical deterministic digital computing models and the soaring energy dissipation levels of IC technology for realising them.
                        <br><br><b>Note:</b> With a brief introduction to reversible and quantum circuits, we will focus on efficient synthesis methodologies for logic synthesis of these circuits including the effects of the existing technologies.

                        <p style="color:rgb(253, 190, 243); text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "> <b>Speaker:</b> Kenichi Morita, Hiroshima University, Japan</p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240); text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "><b>Abstract:</b> A reversible cellular automaton (RCA) is said to be "time-reversal symmetric" (T-symmetric, for short) if its forward and backward evolution processes are both governed by the same local transition function. We show that the framework of partitioned cellular automata (PCAs) is useful for studying this property. Here, we consider elementary triangular partitioned CAs (ETPCAs), and elementary  square partitioned CAs (ESPCAs). It is shown that all reversible ETPCAs, and about 58 percent of reversible ESPCAs are T-symmetric under simple transformations on configurations. The transformations used here are

                            They are somewhat similar to the CPT-symmetry in physics. The obtained results on T-symmetries are used to find and analyze backward evolution processes in reversible PCAs. In particular, for a given functional module implemented in a reversible PCA, we can obtain its inverse module very easily using its T-symmetry.  For example, from a Switch Gate configuration, an inverse Switch Gate configuration is automatically obtained, and thus a Fredkin gate is implemented easily. 
                            <br>
                            It is also possible to have an inverse reversible Turing machine from a forward one. By this method, designing larger functional objects and reversible machines in RCAs can be simplified.

The most usual way to reach such an agreement is by using time, for which the existence of a global clock is needed. The synchronous systems are “disciplined”, but it takes away the independence of the elements of a system. On the contrary, the elements of an asynchronous system can act independently. Question is, can asynchronous systems achieve the goals of synchronous systems? We shall inquire this question through reversibility, which refers to a phenomenon that allows a system to go back without losing any information. We shall introspect this issue through the eyes of cellular automata.

Over the course of more than four decades, he has been a pioneer in the development and application of computational thinking—and has been responsible for many discoveries, inventions and innovations in science, technology and business. Wolfram was educated at Eton, Oxford and Caltech. He published his first scientific paper at the age of 15, and had received his PhD in theoretical physics from Caltech by the age of 20. Wolfram's early scientific work was mainly in high-energy physics, quantum field theory and cosmology, and included several now-classic results. Having started to use computers in 1973, Wolfram rapidly became a leader in the emerging field of scientific computing, and in 1979 he began the construction of SMP—the first modern computer algebra system—which he released commercially in 1981. In recognition of his early work in physics and computing, Wolfram became in 1981 the youngest recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. Late in 1981 Wolfram then set out on an ambitious new direction in science aimed at understanding the origins of complexity in nature. Wolfram's first key idea was to use computer experiments to study the behavior of simple computer programs known as cellular automata. And starting in 1982, this allowed him to make a series of startling discoveries about the origins of complexity. The papers Wolfram published quickly had a major impact, and laid the groundwork for the emerging field that Wolfram called complex systems research.

                        <p style="color:rgb(253, 190, 243); text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "> <b>Speaker:</b> Smita Sirker, Jawaharlal Nehru University</p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240); "><b>Abstract:</b> The talk will focus on some of the possible understanding of reversibility – whether the concept of reversibility is uniform in its applications across different philosophical issues. For instance, the concepts of negation and absence are prevalent in our philosophical discourse. Let us consider a particular case. When we experience an ‘absence of x’ in a certain setup, our perception of that absence (of x) is mediated through the perception of the present (perceptually visible) objects, as we construe mentally what the earlier perceptual configuration (of that scenario) was. In this very act of mental construction (as memory), the contrast between an earlier (temporal) content of perception and the present content of perception (which is our perception of absence of x), we have a reconstruction of the perceived absence. Whether this perceptual construct of absence via the perception of the present (objects) can be treated as reversibility to an earlier temporal (phenomenal) perception? Likewise, we will discuss some other cases and through their analyses try to capture the sense of reversibility. We will try and show how the concept of reversibility (not always in a uniform sense) applies across contexts like moral scenarios, discussions of negation, perception of absence, etc.
