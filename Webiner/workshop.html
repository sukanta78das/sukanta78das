As an example of cellular automaton, we shall discuss the Game-of-Life, a zero-player game
                            developed by John Conway. Two special classes of configurations named Finite configurations and Periodic configurations will also be discussed in this talk. We shall then turn our attention to Elementary Cellular Automata,
                            a class of one-dimensional binary cellular automata. Finally, we shall conclude our talk by finite and linear cellular automata.

Starting from the miniature devices, which are often resource constrained, to the pervasive omni-present
                            cloud, all avenues for a potential attack need to be mitigated. In this talk, we discuss starting from physical security of the "things" in an IoT framework to developing dedicated cryptographic techniques for delegating data
                            in the cloud. The talk covers several topics involving secured implementation, by addressing issues like side channel analysis countermeasures, physically unclonable functions, their adoption in the context of IoT security,
                            and finally new encryption techniques suited for delegating processing on the cloud, yet ensuring privacy of information.

Due to the simplicity and purity of the concept, they have found applications in modeling various
                            physical systems. Cellular automata can also be viewed as massively parallel computers consisting of a uniform array of very simple computing elements with local interconnections. In this talk we review classical results such
                            as the Garden-of-Eden-theorem and Hedlund's theorem. Reversibility and surjectivity of cellular automata are of particular interest. We recall several undecidable questions concerning cellular automata, and survey results on
                            topological dynamics aspects such as sensitivity and mixing properties. The aim is to provide a brief overview of classical cellular automata theory.

Typical situations include linear cellular automata where the states
                            come from a finite field or a finite commutative ring, and so-called additive cellular automata in the case the states come from a finite commutative group and the cellular automaton is a group homomorphism. In this talk we
                            generalize the setup and consider so-called group cellular automata whose state set is any (possibly non-commutative) finite group and the cellular automaton is a group homomorphism. The configuration space may be any group
                            shift - a subshift that is a subgroup of the full shift - and still many properties are decidable in any dimension of the cellular space. Our decidability proofs are based on algorithms to manipulate group shifts, and on viewing
                            the set of space-time diagrams of group cellular automata as multidimensional group shifts. The trace shift and the limit set of the cellular automaton are lower dimensional projections of the space-time diagrams and they can
                            be effectively constructed. This view provides algorithms to decide injectivity, surjectivity, equicontinuity, sensitivity and nilpotency of the cellular automaton. Non-transitivity is semi-decidable. We also easily establish
                            that injectivity always implies surjectivity, that transitivity implies mixingness, that non-sensitivity implies equicontinuity, and that jointly periodic points are dense in the limit set. The talk is based on a joint work
                            with Pierre Béaur.

                            chance of getting selected irrespective of the order of the objects. In fact, this notion of randomness is one of the most perplexing and frequently encountered concepts in nature and society. In the philosophy of science,
                            randomness is often related to indeterminism, unpredictability, probability and chance. It is also often associated with information entropy. Thanks to quantum mechanics and chaos theory, some even consider nature as random
                            at a fundamental level. This makes the study of randomness a bewitching observation of nature.

In fact, uniformly is everywhere in the structure of a cellular automaton. Synchronicity is also one
                            kind of uniformity where all the cells are forced to get updated simultaneously. However, uniformity constraint of cellular automata has been questioned over the years and as a result, non-uniformity in cellular automata structure
                            has been introduced. Due to the introduction of non-uniformity, we get three classes of non-classical cellular automata - Automata Networks, Asynchronous Cellular Automata and Hybrid Cellular Automata. Hybrid Cellular Automata
                            are also known as Non-uniform Cellular Automata. In this talk, we shall spend more time on this class of cellular automata. The Non-uniform Cellular Automata have been explored since late 1980s with a target to use them as
                            Technology. In this talk, we shall briefly revisit some application areas where the Non-uniform Cellular Automata have been used as potential solutions.

However, these devices are
                            also at the exposure of adversaries who can launch powerful physical attacks to subvert their security. These physical attacks, often called side channel attacks (SCA), work by monitoring the power consumption pattern, and
                            electromagnetic radiations around the device leading to strong attack vectors which can subvert any cryptosystem irrespective of its mathematical strength. However, designing SCA-countermeasures are very costly, rendering them
                            unsuitable for such constrained platforms. In this talk, we address this challenging problem of achieving lightweightness but ensuring a side channel leakage tight design. In particular, we address the two important pieces
                            of the puzzle, the S-Box and the diffusion layer, which together forms the core of a block cipher. We explore design strategies for substitution-permutation network (SPN)-based block ciphers that make them amenable to low-cost
                            threshold implementations (TI) - a provably secure strategy against side-channel attacks. The core building blocks for our strategy are cryptographically optimal 4×4 S-Boxes,implemented via repeated iterations of simple cellular
                            automata (CA) rules. We present highly optimized TI circuits for such S-Boxes, that consume nearly 40% less area and power as compared to popular lightweight S-Boxes such as PRESENT and GIFT. Subsequently, we discuss the challenges
                            in choosing diffusion layers for such S-Boxes and some suggested solutions. We finally make an attempt to combine these puzzle pieces in a VLSI design to show an end-end "light-but-tight" block cipher.
