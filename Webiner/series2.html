                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240);text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "><b>Abstract:</b> While studying the reversibility (i.e. injectivity) of infinite and finite cellular automata (CAs), one can identify (at least) the following four cases: <br>1. An infinite CA whose global function is injective
                            on the set of “all infinite configurations”.<br> 2. An infinite CA whose global function is injective on the set of “all periodic configurations”.</br>
                            3. An infinite CA whose global function is injective on the set of “all finite configurations of length n” for all n∈ℕ.</br>
                            4. A finite CA whose global function is injective on the set of “all configurations of length n” for a fixed n.</br>
                            Hence, in one-dimension, cases 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent, and Case 4 is different from them. To decide reversibility of a finite CA (Case 4), we need to know both the rule and the CA size. But, for infinite CAs, reversibility is decided based on the local
                            rule only. Therefore, apparently, these two seem to be divergent. To construct a bridge between these two cases, reversibility of CAs is redefined and the notion of semi-reversible CAs is introduced. Hence, we get a new classification
                            of finite CAs – (1) reversible CAs (reversible for every n∈ℕ), (2) semi-reversible CAs (reversible for some n∈ℕ) and (3) strictly irreversible CAs (irreversible for every n∈ℕ). We then use a well-known characterization tool,
                            Reachability Tree and devise an algorithm to decide whether a finite CA is reversible or semi-reversible. This leads us to a new relationship between reversibility of finite and infinite CAs.

                            to the theory of Wang tiles and Cellular Automata. He received his Ph.D in 1990 from the University of Turku.In a remarkable work, he has proved that the reversibility of two-dimensional CA is an undecidable problem. He is
                            one of the pioneers of developing security systems using reversible CA. His research interest also includes computation theory, automata theory and image compression. Besides serving as chair, committee member and editor of

                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240); "><b>Abstract:</b> Wang tiles, or square tiles with local matching rules, are a convenient and visual way to describe two-dimensional subshifts of finite type. The domino problem is the decision problem to determine if a given finite
                            set of Wang tiles admits a tiling of the infinite plane. The problem is closely related to aperiodicity, the property of some tile sets that they only admit tilings that are not periodic. A classical result by R. Berger from
                            the 1960's states that aperiodic tile sets exist, and that the domino problem is undecidable: no algorithm exists that correctly solves the domino problem for every finite tile set. Wang tiles easily translate into two-dimensional
                            cellular automata so that aperiodicity yields cellular automata with unexpected properties, and the undecidability of the domino problem leads to various undecidable problems concerning cellular automata. In particular, reversibility
                            of a two-dimensional CA cannot be decided by an algorithm. Even one-dimensional cellular automata theory benefits from tiles: space-time diagrams can namely be viewed as tilings with determinism properties. In this talk we
                            review these topics and explain some old results.

                        <p style="color:rgb(187, 255, 240);text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; "><b>Abstract:</b> Classically, cellular automata and, in fact, automata networks in general, have synchronous dynamics defined by a local function. But the interest on asynchronous versions of both systems has grown, since it provides
                            an extra degree of freedom. The standard way to define deterministic asynchronism is to set an update priority to each node. It has been shown that these networks can solve problems that were not previously solvable with synchronous
                            systems. However, such a way to define asynchronism depends totally on the relative position of the node in the network. Here, we propose a new way to look at asynchronism in such systems, in that the priority now relies on
                            the state transitions of the system's underlying local function. This leads to a scalable way to add deterministic asynchronism in such networks. Taking the elementary cellular automata space as a baseline, we carry out a complete
                            characterisation of its dynamics using the proposed asynchronism update scheme.
